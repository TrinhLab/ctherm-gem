# Files
- The file `./wt_v_hydg-ech.csv` was created from `./07142015wt_v_hydG-ech_25pct3.xlsx` by extracting the columns corresponding to the growth phase samples comparing WT and hydg-ech.

- The file `./inferno_rrollup.csv` was created from `./07142015wt_v_hydG-ech_25pct3.xlsx` by extracting the columns corresponding to all samples.
